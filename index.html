<p> In terms of career path I'm still figuring it out. 
    <br> I originally planned on being a zoololgy major
    <br>in hopes to go into the field of wildlife rehabilitation and rescue.
      <br>Now im still playing with my options, one being web design. 

      <p>I love playing basketball, working out, and surfing. I really enjoy live music.
    <br> I also enjoy photography. I love taking pictures of my friends and being able to capture memories for others. </p>
